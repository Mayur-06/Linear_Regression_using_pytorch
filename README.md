# PyTorch Linear Regression

This repository contains code and resources for implementing linear regression using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework. The project includes two notebooks demonstrating two different approaches to linear regression:

1. **Simple Linear Regression**: In this notebook, we implement linear regression from scratch using PyTorch tensors and autograd for gradient computation. The notebook covers data generation, model creation, loss computation, gradient descent optimization, and model evaluation.

2. **Linear Regression with Built-in Modules**: This notebook demonstrates how to use PyTorch's built-in modules, such as `torch.nn.Linear` and `torch.optim`, to implement linear regression. This approach simplifies the code by leveraging PyTorch's high-level abstractions for model creation, loss computation, and optimization.

## Introduction

Linear regression is a fundamental technique in machine learning and statistics used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. PyTorch provides a flexible and efficient framework for implementing linear regression models, allowing for easy experimentation and customization.
